# Clo-Synth

## About
Co-Synth is a monophonic synthesizer built with Tone.js and p5.js.

## Goal
My goal with this project was to challenge myself by working with unfamiliar JavaScript libraries and to hone my vanilla JavaScript skills. I also wanted to build something that could be enjoyed by anyone who comes across it. Clo-Synth is designed to be approachable for those who are unfamiliar with musical synthesizers while still appealing to synth fans as a fun, interactive project.

## Features:
- 4 different waveforms
  - Sine
  - Triangle
  - Sawtooth
  - Square
- ADSR amplitude envelope
- Ability to use your computer keyboard to play notes
- Waveform visualizer
